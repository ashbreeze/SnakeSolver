# SnakeSolver
A Java based bruteforcer for snake puzzles.

Comes ready to run for puzzles with square blocks and straight / 90 degree pieces. In theory it could be modified for different geometric shapes such as triangles although it would probabaly require an overhaul of the grid system as the current only supports 90 degree rotations.

Custom shapes (constraints) can be easily defined. Comes with a premade cube.
